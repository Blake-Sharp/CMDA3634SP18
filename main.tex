\section{Questions}

\subsection{Question F}
No, This does not always give the same answer, but it does run faster. The difference between 5-8 cores is pretty negligable. The difference between 1-4 cores does seem to be significant.
\subsection{Plots}
The plots was used on the local machine with 1-8 cores because that is what I have access to. The class got crazy towards the end trying to get onto New River, but the same concepts should hold true with more cores at our disposal. I couldn't get TA attention to get the multitude of New River cores, but the results could easily be observed on my local computer anyway!The pdf's are attached but I could not figure out how to get these visible on latex. Sorry in advance.
